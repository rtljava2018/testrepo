Berlin Clock
============
Project Overview
----------------

This project is a **Berlin Clock** built with **Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Hilt DI**. It demonstrates **clean architecture principles**, **test-driven development (TDD)**, and **state-driven UI**.

Clock Rules
-----------

*   The **top lamp** blinks to show seconds (on for even seconds, off for odd seconds).
*   The next two rows represent **hours**:
    *   Upper row: 4 red lamps, each representing 5-hour blocks.
    *   Lower row: 4 red lamps, each representing 1-hour blocks.
*   The final two rows represent **minutes**:
    *   Upper row: 11 lamps, each representing 5-minute blocks. Every third lamp is red, the rest are yellow.
    *   Lower row: 4 yellow lamps, each representing 1-minute blocks.
